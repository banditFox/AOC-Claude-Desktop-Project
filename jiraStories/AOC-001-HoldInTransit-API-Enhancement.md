# **Story**

---

As a **Solution Owner**, I would like to **enhance the backend API to include database calls to the 'holdInTransit' table** so that **the system can properly track and manage cases that are temporarily held during processing**.

>[!info] **Filled out by PO, SO or SA**
>A user story is high-level descriptions of a user's requirements written from the end user's perspective

# **Out of Scope**

---

- Frontend UI changes to display holdInTransit data
- Migration of existing data to the new table structure
- Performance optimization of the holdInTransit table queries
- Implementation of bulk operations on holdInTransit records

>[!info] **Filled out by SA. SO , XD or PO**
>Anything that is outside the parameters or does not fall within the established scope of the backlog item. Provide, if available or otherwise mark as 'N/A". 

# **Assumptions**

---

- The 'holdInTransit' table already exists in the database with the correct schema
- Database connection pooling and configuration are already established
- The existing API framework supports additional database calls
- Required database permissions are already configured for the API service account

>[!info] **Filled out by SA, SO or XD**
>These are assumptions/assertions that are being accepted for implementation. Provide, if available or otherwise mark as 'N/A". 

# **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

---

>[!info] **Filled out by SA. SO or XD**
>AC defines a set of predefined requirements that must be met to mark a user story complete. These are conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other systems.

## **Business Rules** 

- API must support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for holdInTransit records
- API responses must include appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500, etc.)
- All database transactions must be atomic and support rollback on failure
- API must validate required fields before attempting database operations
- Hold records must be associated with valid case identifiers

>[!info] **Filled out by SA. SO , XD or PO**
>List of statements that give you the criteria and conditions for making a decision. Provide, if available or otherwise mark as 'N/A". 

## **Experiences Design** 

N/A - This is a backend API change with no direct UI impact.

>[!info] **Filled out by XD**
>Visual design needed for implementation of the backlog items. Provide, if available or otherwise mark as 'N/A"

## **Technical Process** 

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- GET /api/holdInTransit/{caseId} - Retrieve hold records for a case
- POST /api/holdInTransit - Create new hold record
- PUT /api/holdInTransit/{holdId} - Update existing hold record
- DELETE /api/holdInTransit/{holdId} - Remove hold record

**Database Integration:**
- Implement Data Access Layer (DAL) methods for holdInTransit table operations
- Add appropriate error handling for database connection issues
- Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add logging for all database operations

**Data Model Requirements:**
- Create/update API models that map to holdInTransit table schema
- Implement data validation and sanitization
- Add appropriate data type conversions

>[!info] **Filled out by SA**
>Technical details needed for implementing of the backlog item

## **Security Requirements**

- All API endpoints must require proper authentication and authorization
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized database queries only
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in API responses or logs
- Follow principle of least privilege for database access

>[!info] High level security requirements.

## **Accessibility** 

N/A - Backend API changes do not directly impact accessibility requirements.

## **Testing**

>[!info] Quality check details needed of the backlog item to test functionality
>Provide, if available or otherwise mark as 'N/A"
> **Validated by QE**
> - **Unit Tests - Provided by SA or Dev Lead** 
> - **Manual Testing - Filled out by QE**
> - **Integration/Functional Test - Filled out by QE**

**Dev - Unit Test** 
- Test all CRUD operations for holdInTransit data access methods
- Test API endpoint request/response handling
- Test error handling scenarios (invalid input, database connection failures)
- Test data validation and sanitization logic
- Mock database calls to test business logic in isolation

**QE - Manual Test**
- Verify API endpoints respond correctly using Postman or similar tool
- Test authentication and authorization requirements
- Verify proper HTTP status codes are returned
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate API documentation matches implementation

**QE- Integration/Functional Test**
- Test full API workflow with actual database connections
- Verify database transactions commit/rollback properly
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Performance testing for database query response times
- End-to-end testing with dependent systems

# **Questions**
---

>[!info] Open questions needed to be identified and addressed prior to the story being pulled into a sprint for implementation
> - Tag user who can assist in answering where applicable to minimize meetings 

1. Q: What is the exact schema structure of the holdInTransit table?
    1. A: @DatabaseAdmin - Please provide current table schema and any constraints

2. Q: Are there any existing API patterns or frameworks we should follow for consistency?
    1. A: @TechnicalArchitect - Please review and provide architectural guidance

3. Q: What are the expected volume and performance requirements for these API calls?
    1. A: @ProductOwner - Please provide usage estimates and performance expectations

4. Q: Should the API support pagination for large result sets?
    1. A: @SolutionOwner - Please clarify if pagination is needed based on expected data volume
