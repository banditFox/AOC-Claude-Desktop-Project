# **Story**

---

As a **Solution Owner**, I would like to **enhance the backend API to include database calls to the 'holdInTransit' table** so that **the system can properly track and manage cases that are temporarily held during processing**.

# **Out of Scope**

---

- Frontend UI changes to display holdInTransit data
- Migration of existing data to the new table structure
- Performance optimization of the holdInTransit table queries
- Implementation of bulk operations on holdInTransit records

# **Assumptions**

---

- The 'holdInTransit' table already exists in the database with the correct schema
- Database connection pooling and configuration are already established
- The existing API framework supports additional database calls
- Required database permissions are already configured for the API service account

# **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

---

The following predefined requirements must be met to mark this user story complete:

## **Business Rules** 

- API must support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for holdInTransit records
- API responses must include appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500, etc.)
- All database transactions must be atomic and support rollback on failure
- API must validate required fields before attempting database operations
- Hold records must be associated with valid case identifiers

## **Experiences Design** 

N/A - This is a backend API change with no direct UI impact.

## **Technical Process** 

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- GET /api/holdInTransit/{caseId} - Retrieve hold records for a case
- POST /api/holdInTransit - Create new hold record
- PUT /api/holdInTransit/{holdId} - Update existing hold record
- DELETE /api/holdInTransit/{holdId} - Remove hold record

**Database Integration:**
- Implement Data Access Layer (DAL) methods for holdInTransit table operations
- Add appropriate error handling for database connection issues
- Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add logging for all database operations

**Data Model Requirements:**
- Create/update API models that map to holdInTransit table schema
- Implement data validation and sanitization
- Add appropriate data type conversions

## **Security Requirements**

- All API endpoints must require proper authentication and authorization
- Implement input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized database queries only
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in API responses or logs
- Follow principle of least privilege for database access

## **Accessibility** 

N/A - Backend API changes do not directly impact accessibility requirements.

## **Testing**

**Dev - Unit Test** 
- Test all CRUD operations for holdInTransit data access methods
- Test API endpoint request/response handling
- Test error handling scenarios (invalid input, database connection failures)
- Test data validation and sanitization logic
- Mock database calls to test business logic in isolation

**QE - Manual Test**
- Verify API endpoints respond correctly using Postman or similar tool
- Test authentication and authorization requirements
- Verify proper HTTP status codes are returned
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate API documentation matches implementation

**QE- Integration/Functional Test**
- Test full API workflow with actual database connections
- Verify database transactions commit/rollback properly
- Test concurrent access scenarios
- Performance testing for database query response times
- End-to-end testing with dependent systems

# **Questions**
---

1. Q: What is the exact schema structure of the holdInTransit table?
    1. A: @DatabaseAdmin - Please provide current table schema and any constraints

2. Q: Are there any existing API patterns or frameworks we should follow for consistency?
    1. A: @TechnicalArchitect - Please review and provide architectural guidance

3. Q: What are the expected volume and performance requirements for these API calls?
    1. A: @ProductOwner - Please provide usage estimates and performance expectations

4. Q: Should the API support pagination for large result sets?
    1. A: @SolutionOwner - Please clarify if pagination is needed based on expected data volume
